## Introduction

`seedtool` is a command-line tool for creating and transforming cryptographic seeds of the sort commonly used by blockchain applications.

## Deprecation of C++ SeedTool

The [original SeedTool was written in C++](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli) and is now deprecated. The new SeedTool is a complete rewrite in Rust. The new SeedTool's inputs and outputs are mostly compatible with the old SeedTool, and most of the same command line options are supported. The new SeedTool is more flexible and extensible, and is designed to support additional functionality.

The new SeedTool also exclusively uses Gordian Envelope for exporting and importing seeds with metadata, for sharding seeds with SSKR, and for writing and reading seeds in multipart UR format.

If you have the old SeedTool installed, you should uninstall it before installing the new SeedTool, or ensure that the new SeedTool is in your PATH before the old SeedTool.

## Installation

To install from crates.io, run:

```bash
cargo install seedtool-cli
```

To install from source, clone this repo, change to its root directory and run:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Examples

- Examples of usage can be found in [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md).
- The full user guide is in [MANUAL.md](./MANUAL.md).

## Version History

### 0.1.7: Not Yet Released

- Improved error message for failed SSKR join.

### 0.1.6: July 11, 2024

- The formats `base6`, `base10`, `bits`, `cards`, `dice`, and `ints`, are intended to be used as user-provided input entropy for generating seeds. `seedtool` can use them as input to generate a seed in any of the other formats, or it can generate these directly using the `random` input mode (which you only would need to do when simulating user-generated entropy). However, `seedtool` will now return an error if any of these formats are used for output with anything other than `random` input (the default). This means it will also return an error if asked to convert between these entropy input formats, for example, from `bits` to `dice`, as these are not reversible conversions.

### 0.1.5: July 1, 2024

- No significant changes.

### 0.1.4: June 20, 2024

- The new `--sskr-format` (`-s`) option can be used to specify SSKR output format, including envelope (the default), bytewords (standard, minimal, or URI styles), and `ur:sskr`.
- Parsing SSKR shares autodetects the format, and will handle all of the above formats, and also the legacy `ur:crypto-sskr` format.

## Status - Alpha

`seedtool`  is currently under active development and in the alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing. See [Blockchain Commons' Development Phases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/blob/master/release-path.md).

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian Developer Community**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about interoperable wallet specifications, please use the Discussions area of the [Gordian Developer Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions). This is where you talk about Gordian specifications such as [Gordian Envelope](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/tree/master/Envelope#articles), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), and [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur) as well as the larger [Gordian Architecture](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md), its [Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, and its macro-architectural ideas such as functional partition (including airgapping, the original name of this community).

[**Gordian User Community**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users of the Gordian reference apps, including [Gordian Coordinator](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/iOS-GordianCoordinator), [Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS), [Gordian Server](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS), [Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS), and [SpotBit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit) as well as our whole series of [CLI apps](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Apps.md#cli-apps).
