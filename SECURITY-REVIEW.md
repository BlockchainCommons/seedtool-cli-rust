# Security Review

This project has not yet received a formal security review.

If you wish to use this project in a shipping product, we encourage you to work with us to fund a security review. Previous projects such as [`bc-shamir`](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md) and [`bc-sskr`](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md) have already received security reviews courtesy of existing patrons, such as [Bitmark], allowing you to use those projects with a strong belief in their security properties. By funding a review you can contribute to the set of Blockchain Commons libraries that can be safely used in production projects â€” a large library of cryptography and interoperability products that you do not need to entirely review yourself.

Security reviews are done by third parties. Previous reviews have been done by [Radically Open Security](https://radicallyopensecurity.com/). Following a review, our goal is to make the report open for everyone to see.
